## **HEALPORIUM**
MEDICAL HEALTHCARE WITH FINANCE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The project addresses the issue of fragmented healthcare records and the financial strain on patients who may struggle to afford necessary medical services or medications at critical times due to unsystematic medical record and less details and payment issues. Patients often face difficulties in accessing their historical medical data or paying for medical services upfront, which can result in delayed treatments and increased healthcare costs. There is also a need for a centralized system where doctors, pharmacies, and patients can seamlessly share and access necessary health and billing information in real time.**
